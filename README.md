# Key Provider Demo

This is a [Kobweb](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb) project demo to provide secure keys.

This is the result of the course [Secure API Keys with a Public-Key Cryptography on Android](https://www.udemy.com/course/secure-api-keys-with-a-public-key-cryptography-on-android/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server by typing the following command in a terminal under the `site` folder:

```bash
$ cd site
$ kobweb run
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result.

You can use any editor you want for the project, but we recommend using **IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition** downloaded
using the [Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

Press `Q` in the terminal to gracefully stop the server.
